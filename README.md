**Summer Of Code | Implementation Project**   

***Work Distribution***  

*Checkpoint1*  
 - Completed a course on ML.
   
   
 *Checkpoint2*    
 - Compared different ML/DL models, APIs for speech to text conversion. I found 2 models which had great performance, Wave2Vec2.0[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KW_KUqrEzxgVWBjymwyB4ATJ6blzoKka?usp=sharing)] and VoskAPI .  
  
  
*Checkpoint3*
 - Compared different Denoising Models.
 - Implemented Page-Rank, skip-thoughts algorithm for Text Summarization.
  
    
***Files in the Repository***
 - *requirements.txt* : Contains the list of required python libraries
 - *input.wav* : The audio file used for testing denoising and speech2text models
 - *Page-Rank Summarization Algo* : Contains the code for Page-Rank Implementation[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X0eUMWxix4_JOaCeiU9kro_3jVYg0eUk)]
 - *Skip-thoughts Summarization Algo* : Contains the code for Skip-thoughts Implementation [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pQ6ZsYrkuWsqwjFp87iQGVB0ddkSRRNB#scrollTo=GPP2CYZJhx8_)] Could not implement the code properly as there were many inconsistencies with python 3

 - *Audio_denoising.py* : Denoises the audio
 - *Speech_to_Text.py*: Converts speech to text  
 - *BriefKing.jpeg* : Logo of BriefKing  
 - *Jayant_BriefKing.pdf* : Contains the documentation and notes.
